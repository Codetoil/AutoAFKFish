# AutoAFKFish

A fairly simple fabric mod for 1.14.4-1.20.3, making it so that when you press the F12 Key, it will start acting as if you are holding down the right mouse button. It will keep acting like that even if you open your inventory, open chat, pause on a multiplayer server, and any other action that does not stop the integrated server if you are on a client world, or any action regardless on a server world. You can toggle it off by pressing the F12 Key again (there is a 1.5 second cooldown). Must be used in conjunction with a afk fishing farm.
